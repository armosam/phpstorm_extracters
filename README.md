# PHPStorm Data Extractors

PHP Storm extractors from database to different formats

Currently there are two extractors to extract PHPStorm query results to the PHP array and XML format (for PHPUnit tests).

For installation just download files to the PHPStorm's ```data/extractors``` folder and use it.

To use for example PHP array extractor:
- select and activate it in the PHPStorm as extractor, 
- run your database query, 
- select data you need to extract and copy to the clipboard.

When you past coppied data it should be in the PHP array format. 

There are same steps for XML extractor...

Enjoy it for free :)
